# project-Jarvis-neural-network-for-reactor-control-

this is my first machine learning project where i will try to build an NN
which can predict changes in between the operating variables of a nuclear reactor 
and provide calculated suggestions if the operation will be safe or not 

I hope this will bring necessary safety and make the job very easy for a nuclear reactor operator
